title: "A small step for a man, a quantum of steps for mankind"
---
Long ago computers were analog machines, tailor-made to fulfill one purpose of complex calculations. Today, the very first quantum computers are operational and on them, not only is information stored in atoms, but also the information is not encoded in 1s and 0s only. Quantum systems as whole make sense, but their partitions behave randomly. There is much more to discuss about this, which I would like to in my essay, to have a closer look to Quantum computing, just like IBM Quantum Experience manual says - in black and white and black-and-white.
