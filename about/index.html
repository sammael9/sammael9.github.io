<p>I am a 22 years old IT student from Slovakia.</p>

<p>The idea to study IT came to me first when I was 16 and I got into a compulsory informatics class on my secondary grammar school. Never before did I feel a need to dedicate my entire life to the studies of IT, programming, data science or artificial intelligence. But also never before did I actually know what should I study. At those times, I could excel in any given subject, be it mathematics, literature, biology, chemistry, all I needed was to try I, and I would end up on top of my class or at an even position with the best. I never did consider myself an actual genius, nor did I ever want to become one - I dislike the idea of having supremacy of intelligence over others. All I only ever actually had, and what resulted in my good marks, was pursuit for knowledge, but, when it was easy to obtain it in so many subjects, I realized I had to choose - and the choice appeared in front of me.</p>

<p>After a small research, I decided to study informatics at the Slovak Technical University at Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies, the currently most renowned IT faculty in Slovakia. Here, after grasping the basic concepts of informatics, I chose to focus mainly on the fields of Artificial intelligence, hence my Bachelor's Thesis (Learning of an AI soccer player in a simulated robotic soccer league), but I did find some neat analytical skills within me, and an internship at AT&ampT showed me how to put them to use when it comes do data analysis. Combining these two areas, I found they can be utilized together for various concepts of data mining, data analysis, or with AI agents.</p>

<p>I also am supporter of the concept of Quantum computing and have did some small experiments on the IBM Quantum experience computers, which are basically 5-qubit quantum computers. Although quantum computing is basically still a very new concept and still experimental, I feel very enthusiastic about the future of Quantum computers.</p>

<p>Below are abstracts for some essays I wrote regarding Quantum computers or other topics related to IT. For the entire essays, feel free to contact me, but otherwise I do not want to post them openly on this webpage, thank you for understanding.</p>
